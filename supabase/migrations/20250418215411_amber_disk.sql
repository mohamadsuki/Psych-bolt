  # Allow Anonymous Client Creation

  This migration improves the ability for users to create client records
  without requiring authentication. This is useful for the initial form
  submission flow.

  1. Security
    - Enable RLS for all tables
    - Configure policies to allow anonymous client creation
    - Maintain authentication requirements for sensitive operations
