  # Enhanced Security and Performance Updates

  1. Security
    - Replaces multiple granular policies with unified policies per table
    - Adds anonymous access for shared forms
    - Improves error handling in database functions
    - Adds authentication error handling triggers

  2. Performance
    - Adds performance-optimized indexes
    - Improves error handling and logging
    - Enhances trigger function reliability

  3. Access Control
    - Enables authenticated user access to all tables
    - Adds specific anonymous access for shared forms
    - Implements proper row-level security
